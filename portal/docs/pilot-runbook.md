# Pilot Runbook — taking one real school live

**Audience:** the operator taking a single school onto the portal.
**Proven by:** `apps/api/live/bootstrap-live.mjs` (32 checks, run against an empty database with no demo seed — every step below mirrors a PASS line in that script).

## 0. Provisioning (once, per ADR-010)
- Web (Vercel, `dub1`), API + worker containers (Railway/Render), Postgres (Supabase/Neon, eu-west-1), R2 for backups.
- Set: `DATABASE_URL`, `APP_SECRET` (≥32 chars), `PUBLIC_WEB_ORIGIN` (on the **api and worker** — the worker renders the mail, and the API refuses to boot in production if it is unset, loopback or non-https), `COOKIE_SECURE=true`, `TRUST_PROXY=2`, `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` (the `sk_live_` one — a test key gives parents a checkout that looks real and moves no money), and for email `SMTP_URL` (until then links are shown to admins instead of mailed).
- **Never** set `SEED_DEMO=true` in production — the API refuses to boot with it.

## 1. Bootstrap the first admin
1. Start the API once with `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_EMAIL` + `BOOTSTRAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` (≥12 chars, mixed classes). A `super_admin` account is created and audited (`auth.bootstrap_admin`); the env vars can then be removed.
2. Issue their MFA enrollment token out-of-band:
   `DATABASE_URL=… node scripts/mfa-token.mjs admin@school.ng` (single-use, 24 h).
3. The admin signs in at `/login`, then enrolls TOTP with that token (QR or manual key) and verifies.

## 2. School identity — `/admin/school`
Name, logo URL, colours, contact + DPO email, timezone, currency, mail sender.
The login page, navigation and legal pages pick this up immediately (the endpoint is public before authentication).

The **DPO email is not optional**: `/legal/privacy` and `/legal/retention` tell
data subjects to write to it, and with no address configured those pages
describe rights nobody can exercise. The go-live check (§8) blocks until it is
set, and the legal pages say outright that no contact exists rather than hiding
it.

## 3. Calendar — `/admin/academics`
Create the academic year (mark current) and its terms. Terms drive fee generation and reporting.

## 4. Roster import — `/admin/import`
Order matters; each kind has its own CSV header (shown on the page):
1. **Students** — `email,display_name,password,admission_no,grade_level`. The `password` column is **optional — leave it blank**: each student receives an emailed link to choose their own password (no plaintext in your CSV). A supplied password is treated as temporary: the account is locked to the password-change screen until they replace it.
2. **Staff** — `email,display_name,password,role` (`teacher`, `teacher_assistant`, `registrar`, …). Same password rules as students.
3. **Classes** — `course_code,course_title,name,term_name`.
4. **Enrolments** — `student_admission_no,course_code,section_name,term_name`.
5. **Parents + guardian links** — `student_admission_no,guardian_email,relationship,guardian_name`. Parent accounts are **created automatically** when the email is unknown (with their own set-password link), so the whole parent body imports in one file; the link stays pending until verified.

Without an SMTP server configured, set-password links are listed in the import result instead of emailed — copy them out immediately; they are shown once and expire after 24 h.

**Always dry-run first.** The dry run reports per-row errors (bad email, weak supplied password, grade out of 1–13, duplicate admission no) and writes nothing; **every** problem row is listed, not just the first 500. Commit skips duplicates automatically — re-running a corrected file is safe.

## 5. Guardians
- **Bulk path:** the parents CSV above creates accounts + pending links in one file.
- **Office path:** `/admin/students` → Guardians → **Confirm** (audited).
- **Email path:** the guardian receives a one-time link → `/parent/verify` → confirms. Until then their child shows as *Link pending* and **no child data is visible** (row-level security, not UI).
- Revoke at any time from the same panel.

## 6. Fees — `/admin/fees`
1. Add fee **templates** (name, amount, grade scope, due-in days).
2. **Generate** for a term — one invoice per active student in scope. Re-generating never double-charges: existing (student, term, label) pairs are skipped.
3. Parents pay through the Paystack checkout; the webhook marks invoices paid. Paystack returns them to `PUBLIC_WEB_ORIGIN/fees/return`, which polls until the webhook lands and tells them whether the school has the money — so `PUBLIC_WEB_ORIGIN` must be correct on **both** the api and worker services.
4. The charge is raised in the school's own currency (step 2, `/admin/school`), not hardcoded to naira, and the currency used is recorded on each payment so changing the setting mid-term cannot break payments already in flight. Paystack settles NGN, GHS, ZAR, KES, USD, EGP, XOF and RWF; anything else means invoices only, no online payment. `/reports/go-live` checks this.
5. **Cash and bank transfers** are recorded with *Record payment* on the invoice — they do not touch Paystack. A school that takes no card payments can leave `PAYSTACK_SECRET_KEY` unset; the go-live screen downgrades it to a warning.

## 7. Grading — `/admin/academics` → Grading scale
Set the school's bands (letter, min %, point) and exam/coursework weights. Stored sorted, and **used**: report-card generation applies the weights (exam vs coursework) to produce per-subject percentages, letters and points, plus an overall average/GPA. The scale in force is baked into each snapshot. Report cards are generated **per term** — the term must be chosen explicitly.

**Inviting students individually?** Set the grade level **on the invite** — an invitee cannot supply their own grade or admission number (a made-up number would collide with the real roster later).

## 8. Go-live gate — `/admin/reports`

Two checks live on this page.

**Go-live readiness** runs everything this runbook asks you to confirm and
shows the result. It used to be prose here, which meant nobody ran it:

- **Blocking** (`✕`) — school name and DPO address set, `SMTP_URL` configured,
  a recent backup exists and is off-host, `APP_SECRET` set, `SEED_DEMO` off,
  current academic year and terms, pupils on the roll. Each failure says where
  to go and fix it.
- **Worth fixing** (`!`) — staff still to enrol in two-factor, pupils with no
  guardian or no class, empty classes, a single administrator, an untested
  restore, a stalled retention purge.

Nothing blocking may be outstanding on the first day. The warnings will not
stop the school working, but somebody will notice each one.

**Reconciliation** is the roster acceptance checklist:
- every class shows its true head-count;
- no *students without a verified guardian*;
- no *students without enrolments*;
- no *parents with no child linked*;
- pending guardian links worked to zero.

Only when both are clean should the school stop using its old spreadsheet. From that moment the portal is the system of record (ADR-013).

## 9. First week operations
- **Backups** — the `backup` service takes a nightly AES-256 encrypted `pg_dump`
  (02:15 UTC), uploads it to the configured bucket, prunes to 35 days, and
  restore-tests the newest copy every Sunday. Full scheme, restore procedure and
  drill: [docs/backup-restore.md](./backup-restore.md).
  Before go-live, confirm `GET /api/v1/health` shows `backup.offsite: true` and,
  after the first Sunday, `backup.restoreTest.result: "passed"`.
- **Monitoring** — alert on `/api/v1/health` returning a non-empty `warnings[]`.
  That single check covers stalled backups, failed restore drills, undeliverable
  email and a stuck notification outbox.
- **Email** — `/admin/notifications` is the bounce view. Anything in *failed* or
  *dead* is mail that never arrived; retries back off over roughly 17 hours
  before a message is declared dead, so a row sitting there is a real problem
  (usually a wrong address or an SPF/DKIM rejection), not a transient one.
- **Two-factor rollout** — `/admin/users` → *Two-factor rollout* shows coverage
  and issues enrolment tokens for everyone outstanding in one action, with a
  printable sheet for the staff meeting where it realistically happens.
  **Leave `MFA_ENFORCE=true`.** It is a global kill switch: turning it off to
  get the rollout started would also drop step-up for the admins who have
  already enrolled. Use `MFA_GRACE_UNTIL=<ISO date>` instead — during that
  window staff with no factor yet can sign in and work, staff who have
  enrolled still step up, and super_admins never qualify. The window closes
  itself on the date; `/health` warns while it is open and `/reports/go-live`
  fails until nobody is relying on it. Unset it once coverage is 100%.
- **Leavers** — `/admin/users` → a user's *Offboard* preview lists what they
  still hold (classes taught, children linked, unpaid invoices) before you
  deactivate. Deactivation is reversible; erasure is not.
- **Retention** — `/admin/retention` shows the windows in force, when the purge
  last ran and what it removed, and is where an erasure request is carried out.
  The purge runs in the worker: if the worker is not running, the policy
  published at `/legal/retention` is not being honoured, and the screen says so.
- Staff TOTP resets: `scripts/mfa-token.mjs <email>` (requires the admin endpoint or ops CLI).
- **Activity log** — `/admin/audit`: every write is recorded with actor,
  before/after and a hash chain. *Verify* re-computes the chain and reports any
  row that has been tampered with.

## 10. End of the academic year — `/admin/academics` → End-of-year rollover

The portal is not a one-year tool, but the transition is the single most
far-reaching write it performs: every pupil record moves at once. Treat it as a
scheduled change, not an afternoon click.

1. **Finish the year first.** Publish final marks, close attendance and settle
   or carry over invoices. The rollover never touches them, but you want the
   outgoing year's records settled before the new one starts.
2. **Take a backup you can name.** The nightly dump is enough, but confirm
   `GET /api/v1/health` shows a fresh `backup.completed_at` before you start.
3. **Preview.** Choose the year ending, name the year starting (the dates
   default to one year on), and set the final year group — pupils in it
   graduate instead of moving up. Press **Preview rollover**. Nothing is
   written.
4. **Review the list.** Open *Review all N pupils*. Every repeater, early
   leaver and transfer is set here, one dropdown per pupil; the counts
   re-calculate as you go. Overridden rows are highlighted.
5. **Read the warnings.** Blockers stop the run outright — the common one is a
   final year group set too high, which would push pupils past Year 13. Warnings
   are informational (e.g. how many accounts will be closed).
6. **Commit.** Type the new year's name to confirm, then run it. The whole
   rollover is one transaction: it either completes or leaves the school exactly
   where it was.

What it does and does not do:

| Does | Does not |
| --- | --- |
| Creates the new year and its terms (copied from the outgoing year) | Touch last year's enrolments, marks, attendance or invoices |
| Moves each pupil up one year group, or whatever you overrode | Enrol anybody into the new classes — they are created empty |
| Marks the leaving cohort `graduated` and ends their portal sign-in | Delete any pupil, account or record |
| Recreates the class list in the matching term, optionally with the same teachers | Change fee schedules or guardian links |

**If it was wrong**, press **Undo** on the row in *Previous rollovers*. Every
pupil returns to their previous year group and graduates get their access back.
Classes the rollover created are deliberately left in place — a teacher may
already be using them — so delete those by hand if you do not want them.

Re-running the same pair of years is refused while the first run stands, so a
double-click or a retried request cannot promote anyone twice.

## Rollback
The portal is stateless above Postgres: restore the nightly dump
(`scripts/restore.sh`, see [docs/backup-restore.md](./backup-restore.md)) and
redeploy the previous image tag. Stop `api`, `worker` and `web` before
restoring. Nothing in the pilot writes back to the school's old systems.

Recovery objectives: **RPO ≤ 24 h** (nightly dumps — use managed PITR if the
school cannot accept a day's loss), **RTO ≤ 2 h**. Measure the real RTO during
a drill rather than trusting this number.
