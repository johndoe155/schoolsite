      <p className="muted">Last updated: 2026-10-01 · <strong>Template — requires legal review before production use</strong></p>

      <h2>Purpose</h2>
      <p>This policy describes how long the School Portal retains personal data and the basis for each retention period. It supports compliance with the Nigeria Data Protection Act 2023 (NDPA), FERPA (34 CFR 99), and COPPA.</p>

      <h2>How the schedule is enforced</h2>
      <p>
        A purge job runs daily against the operational windows above and removes the matching
        records. Every run is recorded and entered in the audit log with per-table counts, so the
        school can demonstrate that this page describes what actually happens rather than an
        intention. Records still in use are never purged: an undelivered notification, a live
        session or an import still running is left alone however old it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        Statutory records — marks, attendance, enrolments, fee records, report cards and the audit
        log — are outside the purge. They are retained for the periods in the table above and
        removed or anonymised only when that period expires.
      </p>

      <h2>Deletion and erasure requests</h2>
      <p>
        Erasure requests are honoured within 30 days. Where a legal obligation requires a record to
        be kept (NDPA §34(4)), it is not deleted: the subject&rsquo;s identifying details are
        irreversibly removed and the remaining record is marked as restricted and kept without a
        named subject until its statutory window expires. Before any erasure is carried out, the
        school is shown exactly which records will be removed and which must be retained, and why.
      </p>

      <h2>Backups</h2>
      <p>
        Database backups are encrypted (AES-256) and retained for 35 rolling days, with the newest
        copy restore-tested weekly. Data deleted under this schedule may persist in a backup until
        that copy expires.
      </p>

      <h2>Children&apos;s Data (COPPA / NDPA §28)</h2>
      <p>
        A guardian reaches a child&apos;s record only through a link the school creates and the
        guardian confirms from their own email address; until that confirmation, no data about the
        child is visible to them. Guardians may request deletion of their child&apos;s data at any
        time, subject to the statutory retention obligations above, and the request is carried out
        and recorded through the portal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Limit of this portal:</strong> it does not store pupils&apos; dates of birth, so it
        cannot identify which pupils are under 13, and it does not hold the parental consent taken
        at enrolment. Both live in the school&apos;s admissions records. Capturing consent per pupil
        inside the portal is a known gap, tracked alongside automatic leaver anonymisation.
