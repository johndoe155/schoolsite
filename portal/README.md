| 6 | **Review round 2 — all findings fixed 2026-10-02** | Role-grant hierarchy (privilege-escalation fix), CSP per-request nonce middleware, NAT-friendly rate limits (per-email strict / per-IP generous), PGlite fatal in production, MFA recovery codes + admin reset, invite-based admin UI, parent-pay exception, SSO httpOnly flow cookie + oid/tid linking + per-provider email_verified, health 503 on DB-down, encrypted outbox tokens, atomic idempotency, migration advisory lock, Caddy TLS in compose, NOLOGIN portal_app, k6 (wired into CI 2026-10-03), prod-only Docker image, in-app legal pages (48 API tests, 54 web checks) |
| 6 | [Privacy policy](docs/legal/privacy-policy.md) · [Terms](docs/legal/terms-of-service.md) · [Retention & export](docs/legal/data-retention.md) | FERPA/COPPA/NDPA-aligned · in-app at `/legal/*` (templates — need lawyer review) |
| 6 | [Real-school bootstrap — pilot runbook](docs/pilot-runbook.md) (ADR-013) | **Complete 2026-10-02** — one real school, zero demo data: bootstrap admin + ops-CLI MFA, school identity, years/terms, CSV import (dry-run + dedupe) for students/staff/guardians/classes/enrolments, guardian verification (email token **or** office confirm), fee templates with idempotent generation, grading config, reconciliation report as go-live gate · new admin screens: Students/Academics/Import/Reports/School · **67 API tests · 56 web smoke checks · 32/32 live bootstrap checks on an empty DB** |
| 7 | [Go-live plan](docs/go-live-plan.md) — the production-readiness pass | **Complete 2026-10-03** — the portal is operable by a school, not just demonstrable. Docker build fixed · real branded email templates over SMTP with SPF/DKIM/DMARC records and retry-with-backoff + dead-letter screen · roster import as a resumable background job (multipart upload, batching, progress, error CSV) · encrypted off-host backups with a weekly restore drill surfaced on `/api/v1/health` · offboarding, audit-log screen, academic-year rollover and bulk two-factor onboarding · retention purge and right-to-erasure that match the published legal pages · go-live readiness checks · CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) · **229 API tests · 56 web smoke checks** |
| 7b | Review round 3 — the seven findings of 2026-10-03 | Worker `PUBLIC_WEB_ORIGIN` (every emailed link pointed at the recipient's own machine) · notification preferences and RFC 8058 one-click unsubscribe behind the `List-Unsubscribe` header that had always 404'd · half-built Web Push removed · Paystack env-var name, `callback_url`, return page and school currency · dated two-factor grace window replacing the MFA_ENFORCE contradiction · legal pages corrected (scrypt not bcrypt, DPIA recorded not asserted, no invented consent) · CI finally runs the web smoke suite and k6 · **256 API tests · 61 web smoke checks** |

## What state this is in

Phases 1–6 built the product. **Phase 7 (`docs/go-live-plan.md`) made it
operable**: the gap that mattered was not missing features but promises the
product did not keep — emails that were raw JSON dumps, backups that did not
match their runbook, legal pages describing a purge and an erasure right that
did not exist, and an import that fell over on a real school's roster.

Before a real school uses this, work through
[`docs/pilot-runbook.md`](docs/pilot-runbook.md) and get
**/admin/reports → Go-live readiness** green. It executes the runbook's
checklist — SMTP, backups, restore drill, DPO address, two-factor coverage,
calendar, roster — and blocks on the things that genuinely cannot wait.

Five things only the school can do, listed in the go-live plan: publish the
SPF/DKIM/DMARC records, supply `SMTP_URL`, provision the backup bucket and
`BACKUP_ENCRYPTION_KEY`, have a lawyer review the legal templates, and provide
the real roster.

## Running it

Every environment variable the stack reads is documented in [`.env.example`](.env.example).

## Phase 1 at a glance

> The architecture Phase 1 set out. Where the built system differs, the
> difference is noted — a target described in the past tense is how a reader
> ends up believing a feature exists.

- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 (App Router) · React 19.2 · TypeScript strict · Tailwind v4 + shadcn/ui · TanStack Query. **No PWA:** the planned Serwist service worker and offline attendance were never built, and the half of Web Push that had been written (subscribe endpoints, a table, a dependency) was removed in migration 0015 rather than left to report "sent" for notifications that reached nobody. Guardians are alerted by email, with per-category opt-out at `/account/notifications`. A real PWA remains on the roadmap.
- **API:** NestJS 12 modular monolith · REST + OpenAPI 3.1 · Socket.IO gateway · BullMQ workers
- **Data:** PostgreSQL 18 + Row-Level Security · Redis 7 (sessions, cache, queues) · S3/R2 for files · read replica
- **Identity:** Microsoft Entra ID / Google Workspace via OIDC + PKCE · local email+passkey for parents · MFA (TOTP/WebAuthn) enforced for staff
- **Security:** BFF httpOnly session cookies · TLS 1.3 · AES-256-GCM envelope encryption on PII columns with HMAC blind indexes · append-only audit log
- **Compliance:** FERPA · COPPA under-13 gate · WCAG 2.2 AA · Nigeria NDPA 2023 + GAID 2025 where applicable
